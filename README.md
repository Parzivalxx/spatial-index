## spatial index

This project aims to implement some popular data structures used in spatial database indexes, namely the Quadtree and KDtree, in code. There is support for some common operations such as insert, delete, range and knn queries.

Furthermore, this project aims to develop a simple web application to provide a visualization of the query time and outputs. It supports users in verifying the correctness of their outputs and the efficiency of the query operations for the different indexes.
